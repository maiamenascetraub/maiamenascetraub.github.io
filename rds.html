                <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>
                       This fast-paced project, developed through Northwestern University's selective capstone program in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory, focused on creating a haptic-robot telemanipulation system for remote handling
			    of hazardous materials. The goal was to enable chemists to safely and precisely control robotic fingers from a distance using a wearable exoskeleton. I led the mechanical design, fabrication, and iterative prototyping of
			    a haptic thumb mechanism with two actuated and one passive degree of freedom. Over a 20-week development cycle, I optimized the design for structural performance, manufacturability, and ease of assembly, using CNC 
			    machining, waterjet cutting, and 3D printing. I also co-developed and integrated custom PCBs for power regulation and CAN-based communication, supporting full-system testing and deployment.

                        <h2>System Overview</h2>
                            <p> 
                                Our team meticulously designed the mechanical, electrical, and software components of this project within just five months, ultimately developing a novel approach 
                                to human-robot devices that offers distinct advantages over existing systems. Unlike other haptic or robotic hand systems that struggle to accurately translate forces 
                                between the robot and the userâ€”often causing rigid objects grasped by the robot to feel squishy to the operatorâ€”our design ensures precise force feedback. This 
                                precision is crucial when operators need to work with delicate equipment to manipulate small objects. <br>
        
                                Traditional power transfer solutions fall short in this application: gear-train systems exhibit noticeable backlash, linkages are overly complex and hinder a low-profile 
                                design, and pneumatic or hydraulic systems cannot match the force exerted by the human hand. To overcome these challenges, we chose a cable-driven design powered by 
                                brushless DC motors positioned near the operator's palm. This approach eliminates system play while maintaining a slender and robust mechanical structure. The use of 
                                cables enabled us to focus on a high-gain controller, providing operators with an accurate representation of the robotâ€™s interactions.<br>
                                
                                The system comprises distinct haptic and robotic components for both fingers and thumbs, each featuring two actuated degrees of freedom and a third passive degree of 
                                freedom. This configuration allows for natural and precise motion while ensuring the design remains feasible within the projectâ€™s timeframe. <br> 
                                
                                I developed a modular electrical system for these robotic and haptic devices, creating three different PCBs to manage power, communication, and control for each subsystem. The 'power board' 
                                supplies and regulates power across four distinct domains, ensuring stable voltage with multiple user and system protections. The 'data board' supports real-time communication 
                                through a dual CAN bus architecture, controlled by a Teensy microcontroller and equipped with fault-tolerant transceivers for both intra-system and inter-system communication. 
                                High-resolution magnetic encoders deliver essential feedback for motion control, while integrated safety mechanisms, including emergency stops and system monitoring, protect both 
                                the operator and the hardware.

                            <p> 
                                The goal of the haptic thumb system (pictured above) was to create a haptic interface for the robotic thumb with two actuated degrees of freedom while providing 
				a comfortable workspace for the userâ€™s thumb.  Given this constraint, we broke down the thumb motion into two principal functional motions that we defined 
				ourselves: CMC planar rotation â€˜wagglingâ€™ of the thumb and MCP/IP 'curling'.  These two degrees of freedom make up two subsystems of our design as well as 
				a third subsystem consisting of the thimble holster interface to the userâ€™s thumb. The MCP/IP subsystem and the thimble subsystem each contain an unactuated 
				passive degrees of freedom to provide greater comfort to the user during our curl motion. The mechanical system block diagram below depicts the subsystems and 
				their major components and the decomposed motions are also depicted in the figure below

                        <h2>Cable Routing</h2>
                            <p> 
                                The haptic thumb system makes use of three vented screws to tension the cables: one in the CMC subsystem and two in the MCP/IP subsystem. The configuration shown 
				below creates a 1.4:1 coupling <br>
  
				The CMC cable is wrapped around the CMC Motor Pulley 3 times and is terminated through a wire-lockable screw at one end of the system. The other side of the cable 
				is wired through the CMC plate (illustrated by the dashed pink line below) and is then wired through a vented screw and terminated with a copper crimp. The cable 
				is tensioned off of the MC plate by unscrewing the vented screw in the counterclockwise direction against a wingnut. <br>

				The MCP/IP cable is wrapped around the MCP/IP Motor Pulley 3 times, traversing through a drilled hole in the center of the pulley, and is wired across the CMC system 
				through the use of 3 idler pulleys/shafts. The CMC idler pulley sits on the CMC shaft and allows the motor pulley to be remotized to the same location as the CMC 
				motor pulley. This pulley has 2 grooves that allow for 1 wrap in each direction. The horizontal idler shaft is located between the CMC idler and the vertical 
				idler shaft and guides one side of the cable to the location of the MCP/IP pulley, allowing the cable to approach the pulley perpendicularly to its surface. 
				The vertical idler shaft is located between the horizontal idler shaft and the MCP/IP pulley, and guides one side of the cable towards the MCP/IP surface in a way 
				that allows it to wrap tangentially in both directions. The cable is terminated at each end using copper crimps with a vented screw and wingnut that create tension 
				in the cable by rotating in the counterclockwise direction off of a tensioning block and a hex nut underneath to lock the configuration. <br>

                        <h2>CAD Model</h2>
                            <p> 
                                The full CAD model of the haptic thumb system is shown above.  The motors and connection points between the different subsystems are outlined.  The CMC Side Plates provide
				a mounting point for the haptic thumb system to connect to the rest of the haptic system.  The MCP Side Plates are attached to the CMC Plate to connect the CMC and MCP/IP 
				systems together. The Phalanx Proximal Plates connect to the compliant Phalanx Distal Plate to connect the Thimble system to the rest of the haptic system.  The Inner and
				Outer Thimble connect the user to the haptic system.  Different views of the subsystems are shown below to highlight the different parts and features. <br>

				All bearings within the system are designed to be push fit with both the plates and the shafts. All plates should be manufactured using CNC milling and reaming, and 
				shafts/pulleys were turned on the manual lathe. All components were designed to be made out of metal, with the exception of the inner thimble, which is designed to 
				be made out of 3D printed TPU.

                        <h2>CMC Subsystem</h2>
                            <p> 
                                The CMC subsystem is depicted above, with joint limits set at 0Â° and 70Â° by a spacer separating the top and bottom plates. This subsystem utilizes a ~5:1 cable drive 
				transmission ratio, determined by the radii of the CMC plate and CMC motor pulley. <br>

				The assembly process begins with the top plate sub-assembly, which includes the CMC top plate, ECX 22 XL motors, 2-piece collar shafts, and motor pulleys. These components 
				are assembled together to ensure alignment and secure attachment. Next, the CMC plate is assembled with the bottom plate, incorporating the CMC shaft and idler pulley. 
				This step may require a clamp or a second set of hands to maintain alignment. At this point, the cable routing for the CMC is performed. The CMC cable is wrapped around 
				the CMC motor pulley three times, terminated through a wire-lockable screw, and routed through the CMC plate, vented screw, and copper crimp. Once the cable is properly 
				tensioned, the spacers between the top and bottom plates can be added. Finally, the horizontal idler shaft is installed on the CMC plate, completing the mechanical assembly
				of the CMC subsystem.

                        <h2>MCP/IP Subsystem</h2>
                            <p> 
                                The components of the MCP/IP subsystem are depicted above. The active MCP joint is driven at a 3.5:1 transmission ratio due to the diameter of the MCP pulley and two sets of 
				spacers contact the edge of the MCP side plates to create the mechanical joint limits providing 77 degrees of rotational motion. The MCP pulley is clearance fit on the MCP 
				shaft and loctite was used to constrain the pulley rotation to the shaft rotation. As a result, the pulley as well as all of the proximal phalanx plates rotate together. 
				This subsystem can be assembled separately from the CMC subsystem and attached at a later time, meaning that the CMC joint does not need to be re-tensioned if repairs or 
				adjustments need to be made to the MCP/IP subsystem. <br>

				Assembly for this subsystem involves locating all of the components (spacers, bearings, and plates) on the MCP shaft with the exception of the phalanx proximal plates. At 
				the same time, the vertical idler shaft needs to be located within the bearings in the MCP side plates. Once the inner MCP pulley joint has been assembled, the outer phalanx
				prox and phalanx prox L plates can be attached to the MCP shaft. The shaft and plates for the passive IP joint can be assembled before or after the assembly of the MCP.

                        <h2>Thimble</h2>
                            <p> 
                                The thimble subsystem is designed to provide comfortable but secure attachment between the userâ€™s thumb tip and the haptic system. In order to accommodate multiple thumb sizes, 
				multiple diameters of the thumb tip were printed out of TPU, a flexible polymer that allows for a more comfortable experience. The inner thimble piece can be easily removed and 
				swapped for a different size by unscrewing the bolt that clamps the inner thimble. Multiple iterations of the thimble design were created, including a version that uses an 
				elastic band that wraps around the proximal phalanx of the userâ€™s thumb to secure the thimble on the thumb. Further testing is needed to determine whether the flexibility of TPU 
				is sufficient to prevent slippage or if a more robust thumb attachment strategy is required. Additionally, the system lacks the roll degree of freedom for the thumb tip, which 
				results in a moment around the thumb that could be potentially uncomfortable. Designing and implementing a lightweight but secure roll degree of freedom should be a focus in 
				future iterations.

                        The robot finger subsystem is engineered to closely replicate human finger curling motions, featuring two actively actuated joints that deliver smooth, natural articulation. 
                        Rather than relying on a traditional gear train, it uses a pulley-driven transmission with a 4:1 ratio at each joint, enhancing torque delivery while maintaining a compact profile. 
                        High-performance Maxon EC 45 flat motors supply the requisite torque density without adding bulk. To ensure stability under load, stainless steel cables are tensioned using 
                        simple screws and nuts, and magnetic encoders provide precise positional data for fine-tuned control. Structural components are fabricated through both water jet cutting and CNC 
                        milling for accuracy and durability. While performance and torque efficiency meet design goals, refining linkage interfaces and streamlining the assembly process remains an ongoing priority.

                    <h2>Robot Thumb</h2>
                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/rds/mechanical/rthumb.png" alt="" /></span>
                        Similar to the robot finger, the robot thumb is tailored to replicate the dexterity and form factor of the human thumb, offering two actuated degrees of freedom to produce both 'waggle' (abduction/adduction: motion 
                        that moves the thumb away from the palm) and 'curl' 
                        (flexion/extension: curling or extending your thumb) motions. The 'waggle' joint operates at a 7.33:1 transmission ratio, driven by Maxon ECX Torque 22XL motors for steady, responsive motion. In contrast, the 'curl' 
                        movement uses a 7.94:1 ratio powered by Maxon EC 45 Flat motors, chosen for their compact design and strong torque-to-size ratio. Multiple cable wraps, tensioning blocks, and 
                        CNC-machined pulleys work together to maintain tension. High-precision machining, including turning and milling, ensures tight tolerances and 
                        secure mechanical coupling. Similar to the finger, there are still some issues regarding tensioning which would likely be resolved by refining the pulley system and having an easier method for tensioning.

                    <h2>Haptic Finger</h2>
                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/rds/mechanical/hfinger.png" alt="" /></span>
                        The haptic finger subsystem recreates human finger dynamics, offering two actively controlled joints (MCP and PIP) plus an additional passive degree of freedom for 
                        a more natural range of motion. Stainless steel cables, routed through machined pulleys, maintain precise motion transfer. Cables are tensioned using vented screws 
                        and wing nuts, allowing convenient adjustments and steady performance over time. Similar to other designs Maxon ECX Torque 22XL motors drive the system and are mounted near the palm. 
                        The motors are placed in such a way that they do not interfere with the mounting of the haptic thumb.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Haptic Thumb</h2>
                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/rds/mechanical/thumb.png" alt="" /></span>
                        The haptic thumb subsystem attempts to emulate the range of motion for the human thumb with only 2 driven degrees of freedom. Similar to the robot thumb it offers 'waggle' and 'curl' motions enhanced by an additional passive degree of freedom. Cable 
                        tension is managed via a series of idler pulleys and vented fasteners to achieve smooth, consistent engagement. Maxon ECX motors drive the both the 'waggle' and 'curl' motions, and a rotating
                        fitting allows your thumb to freely swivel within the mechanism. A flexible TPU thimble interface accommodates various thumb sizes while preserving a 
                        secure, ergonomic fit. CNC-machined elements support a sturdy yet lightweight structure. Friction in the cable system occasionally emerges during operation, but we believe this issue could
                        be fixed with higher tolerance pulleys, and a less complex way to tension the cables.
