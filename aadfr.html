                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    Following the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight Flight 370, the Federal Aviation Administration
                    required the implementation of a safe method for securing flight data on passenger aircraft. Due to differing
                    international policy on streaming data from aircraft, Boeing Inc. tasked our team with developing a modular
                    flight-recorder capable of collecting, collating, and securing the data generated generated during a flight.

                <h2>Overview of Our Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    The Aircraft-Automatic Deployable Flight Recorder (A-ADFR) is capable of continually storing over <b>48 hours</b> 
                    of encrypted flight data. Its small, modular design allows it to be stored in the fuselage, wings, flight deck, the tail 
                    of the aircraft, allowing for high redundancy. The device deploys when commanded by external control computers onboard the aircraft, 
                    or when its internal pressure sensor reads a submerged to a depth <b>4 &plusmn; 1 meters</b>. Once deployed the A-ADFR will transmit
                    its location data on a <b>406 MHz</b> frequency band to the COSPAS-SARSAT satellite network for over <b>72 hours</b> so that it may 
                    be located by Search and Rescue efforts.
                </p>

                <h3>Electronic System</h3>
                <p>
                    My main contribution to this project was the end-to-end development and implementation of the electronic system. I designed a PCB
                    that powers all peripheral onboard electronics, automatically switches between the aircraft and internal power supply, controls 
                    the airbag deployment, and charges/manages the onboard Lithium Polymer battery. There is also a Raspberry Pi onboard which manages
                    and stores the data streamed from the aircraft. The system also contains a transceiver and an antenna for the aforementioned 
                    radio communication capabilities.
                </p>

                    <li>Automatically alternates between aircraft power supply and auxiliary power source based upon availability</li>
                    <li>Provides I<sup>2</sup>C Bus for all peripherals to communicate</li>
                    <li>Control circuitry for detonating Guanidine-Nitrate chemical reaction for airbags</li>

                <h3>Housing and Airbags</h3>
                <p>
                    The mechanical system is comprised of a cylindrical housing and three radially-symmetric airbags. The airbags serve 
                    multiple functions, including assisting the housing in breaking free from the debris of the crashed aircraft, enhancing 
                    visibility for locating the device, and providing buoyancy. Within the housing there are two separate chambers, one for 
                    electronics and one for facilitating the chemical reaction which inflates the airbags. The housing is rated to an <b>IPX8</b>
                    waterproofing standard is also <b>self-buoyant</b>, even in the event of multiple ruptured airbags. The Airbag-to-Housing connection
                    consists of swiveling one-way valves, letting each airbag inflate while preventing water ingress to the housing in the event of a 
                    rupture.
